### Data Analyst Capstone Project [Click here](https://github.com/abiyselassie22/IBM-Data-Analyst/tree/master/09.%20Data%20Analyst%20Capstone%20Project)
* Data were collected from several datasets (such as Stack Overflow Survey, Github job postings), web scraped, and explored. <br>
* Data were then wrangled to remove duplicates & impute missing values from the survey dataset, and the cleaned data was normalized. <br>
* Wrangled data was subjected to Exploratory Data Analysis to determine the distribution of the normalized data, and to detect & remove outliers from the survey dataset. <br>
* Various charts were plotted to visualize the distribution, interesting relationships between features, composition and comparison of the data. <br>
* IBM Cognos was employed to create interactive dashboards to identify insights & trends for the current & future yearâ€™s report on emerging technologies & skills which include top programming languages, top databases, Webframes & Platforms. <br>
* Storytelling skills were used to provide a narrative & present data-driven insights dynamically.
